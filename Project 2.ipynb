    "## Task 2: Finding Similar Items\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the frequent pair of items (2-tuples) using the naïve, A-priori and PCY algorithms. For each of these compare the time of execution and results for supports s=10, 50, 100. Comment your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the PCY algorithm, create up to 5 compact hash tables. What is  the difference in results and time of execution for 1,2,3,4 and 5 tables? Comment your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find the final list of k-frequent items (k-tuples) for k=3 and 4. Experiment a bit and describe the best value for the support in each case. *Warning*: You can use any of the three algorithms, but be careful, because the algorithm can take too long if you don't chose it properly (well, basically don't use the naïve approach ;)).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using one of the results of the previous items, for one k (k=2 or 3) find the possible clusters using the 1-NN criteria. Comment your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1-NN means that if you have a tuple {A,B,C} and {C,E,F} then because they share one element {C}, then they belong to the same cluster  {A,B,C,E,F}."
